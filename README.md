# P2MAT - A python based user interface to predict melting point and boiling point of chemical compounds.

---

P2MAT is a GUI that enable user to input SMILEs strings of chemical compounds to predict melting point and boiling point. A pretrained machine learming model is used for the prediction. The core UI is built using [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/).

## Set up

### Environment

This python based software requires python `>=12.3`

#### Conda

A conda software requires to setup environments to run this software. Either [anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download) or [mini-conda](https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/miniconda-install/) can be installed to the system.

### SSH

Open termial and run the following script to install all the required packages under a conda environment named `qsai`:

```bash
sh qsai_install.sh
```

Open `command.sh` file to change the CONDA_BASE_DIR location based on your system.

```bash
CONDA_BASE_DIR=Place your conda location here.
```

Execute the following command form terminal to start the GUI.

```bash
sh command.sh
```

## Usage

### Examples
The workflow of P2MAT software is shown below with an examples.

#### Sample SMILEs
The following sample SMILEs are given for testing perpose.

```chem
